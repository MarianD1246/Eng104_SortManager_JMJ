# Eng104 Console Sort Manager Project

This code is designed to allow a user to sort a random array of integers

## Design Requirements

The flow of using this system should be as follows:

* The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from `Console`
* Decision is given via the command line (using `Console.ReadLine()`)
* The program will then ask for the length of an array via the command line

> **The program should then output:**
> * The unsorted randomly generated array
> * The algorithm to be used
> * The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
> * Time taken

The sorting algorithms uses should include:
* BubbleSort
* MergeSort
* .NET Library Sort Methods
